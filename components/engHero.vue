        <p class="mx-auto text-center sm:w-4/6">
          The Psychosocial Center for Refugees (PSZ) Trier supports, advises and
          treats refugees who have applied for asylum to protect themselves from
          threats and persecution.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="mx-auto text-center sm:w-4/6">
          We at the Psychosocial Center for Refugees work as a team in the city
          of Trier and in the surrounding communities. We know that you went
          through difficult times in your home country and possibly also during
          your flight and that you can still suffer from them. That is why we
          offer a variety of psychological and social support services that you
          will find on this page.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p class="mx-auto text-center sm:w-4/6">We are here for you!</p>
