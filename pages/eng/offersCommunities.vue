          On the one hand, we offer trauma therapy treatment in order to work on
          the experiences that are psychologically stressful for you in the long
          term, but above all to make it easier to deal with them in everyday
          life.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          In addition, we also offer psychosocial counseling and stabilization.
          Here we try to grasp your current life situation, to quickly clarify
          questions in social matters and to relieve your psyche with simple
          exercises and methods.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          Thirdly, where possible, we offer resource-oriented group offers.
